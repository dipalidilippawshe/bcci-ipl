Do provide us with the details** mentioned at the end of this answer. \n\n A couple of quick checks that you will need to perform at your end before you report the issue to us: \n a. Have you enabled all necessary permissions for the EPIC On app on your device? \n It needs Phone/SMS/Messaging and Storage permissions. \n Offline downloads will need Storage permission. To verify permissions, follow these steps: \n Go to Settings > Apps. Scroll down till you see EPIC On and click on it. Now, click on Permissions and enable both 'Phone' and 'Storage' permissions (Note: Options may be named differently on different phones). \n\n b. Have you installed any customized themes? \n Some phones allow you to change the default theme. In some cases, themes may interfere with the functionality of some applications causing frequent app crashes. You might want to reset themes and check if that was causing it. Do write to us if the issue persists after you have reset the theme to default. \n\n **Send us the details of your device: User ID, Device Manufacturer, Device Model Number, Device OS and Version, EPIC On App Version. \n If possible, also send us a screenshot of your 'My Account' page."
